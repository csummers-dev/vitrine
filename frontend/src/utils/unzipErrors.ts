 * Map a zip-extraction failure into a single line of user-facing copy.
 *
 * The backend (PR #5746, `http/unzip.go`) returns plain-text error bodies
 * pulled from `errors/errors.go` (e.g. "the zip file is too large"). We
 * match on those strings so the UI can surface something more meaningful
 * than the raw backend text. Falls back to a generic catch-all for
 * unknown payloads so a bug in the mapper can't silence the error
 * entirely.
 *
 * If the backend ever changes its error wording these mappings will
 * silently regress to the catch-all — keep this file in lockstep with
 * the package-level error vars in `errors/errors.go`.
